Composition techniques are principles abd strategies that artists, photographers,  writers and othercreatives use to organize and arrange elements within their work.

## Visual Arts(Painting, Photography, Design):

## Rule of Thirds:
-- Divide your convas or frame into nine equal parts with two horizontal and two vertical lines. Place key elements along these lines or their intersections to create balance and interest.

## Balance:
-- Achieve balance by distributing visual weight evenly. It can be symmetrical or asymmetrical.

## Leading Lines:
 --Use lines within the composition to lead the viewer's eye to a focal point. This could be roads, rivers, or any other prominen lines.

## Symmetry and Patterns:
-- Create a sense of order and harmony through symmetrical compositions or by utilizing repeating patterns.

## Contrast:
 -- Highlight differences in color, shape, size or other attrubutes to create visual interest and draw attention.

## Framing:
 -- Use elements within the composition to create a frame around the main subject, directing attention to the center.

## Depth and Layering:
 -- Add layers to your composition to create depth. Foreground, middle ground , and background elements can contribute to a sense of three-dimensionality.


#### Writing(Literature, Journalism,etc.):
 ## Three-Act Structure:
Organize narratives into three acts-setup,confronation, and resolution-to create a compelling story arc.

## Show , Don't tell :

 -- Use descriptive language and vivid details to evoke emotions and engage the reader's imagination.

## Point of View(POV):
 -- Choose a narrative perspective(first person, third person, etc) that suits the story and enhances the reader's connection with the characters.
